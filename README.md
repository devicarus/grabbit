### Grabbit is only downloading the latest ~1k saved posts

### What does Grabbit download?
Grabbit downloads (*or at least tries to*) all media from saved posts, including images and videos, as well as metadata such as title, author's username and text if there is any.\
Grabbit **does not** download comments.\
Grabbit **is not** intended for backing up entire subreddits or other users' profiles.
